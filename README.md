# Conway-s-Game-of-Life

In this project, we are interested in developing a simulator for the Game of Life. However, if it is simple to develop a simulator for the Game of Life in the case of a small universe and for a few generations, it is not the same for universes of several million cells whose evolution we want to follow spans over billions of generations.
In the 80s, Bill Gosper proposed the HashLife algorithm that greatly improves the speed of computing patterns in the Game of Life. It is this algorithm that I implement in this project.
